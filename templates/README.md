# Docula Template Readme

Welcome to Docula's templates directory. This directory contains all the templates that Docula uses to generate the documentation. You can add your own templates to this directory and use them to generate your documentation.

To add a template simply create a pull request and add your template under a `unique` folder name. The folder name will be used to identify your template. For example, if you add a template under `my-template` folder, you can use it by running `docula --template my-template`. This will download the template into your `<site_folder>/template` directory and start using it. 

Note that if you want to use your own templates just simply pull down an example template here and put it in the `<site_folder>/template` directory. We will always use that first before looking to use one of the templates in this directory.
